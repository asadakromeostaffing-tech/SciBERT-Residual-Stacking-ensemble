# SciBERT-Residual-Stacking-ensemble
A multi-stage ensemble learning approach for the "Fake or Real: The Impostor Hunt" challenge. It combines base models like SVMs and Neural Networks with stacking meta-learners (LogReg, RF, HistGB). Utilizes SciBERT embeddings and supports GPU acceleration via cuML for enhanced classification performance.
